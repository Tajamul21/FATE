## Abstract

One of the biggest issues facing humanity in the twenty-first century is climate change, as shown by the increasing sealevels, melting glaciers, and frequent storms. Accurate temperature forecasting is crucial for understanding and mitigat-ing its impacts. Cutting-edge data-driven models for temper-ature forecasting typically employ recurrent neural networks(CNNs), with certain models integrating attention mechanisms. However RNNs sequential processing limits paral-lelization, especially for longer sequences. In order to do this,we provide a brand-new method for temperature predictionthat is based on the FocalNet Transformer architecture. Byfunctioning in a multi-tensor format, the suggested Focal-modulation Attention Encoder (FATE) framework leveragesthe spatial and temporal nuances of meteorological data char-acteristics by integrating tensorized modulation. Compara-tive assessments against existing transformer encoder archi-tectures, 3D CNNs, LSTM, and ConvLSTM demonstrate our modelâ€™s superior ability to capture nuanced patterns inher-ent in the data, particularly in the context of temperature prediction. We also introduce a new labeled dataset, Cli- mate change Parameter dataset (CCPD), which encompasses 40 years of data from J&K region on seven key parameters that influence climate change, supporting further research in this area. Experiments on two real-world benchmark temper- ature datasets from weather stations in the USA, Canada, and Europe demonstrate accuracy improvements of 12%, 23%,and 28% respectively, compared to existing SOTA models. In addition, we achieved state-of-the-art results on our CCPD dataset with a 24% improvement. To understand FATE, we introduce two modulation scores from the tensorial modu- lation process. These scores clarify our modelâ€™s decision- making and key climate change parameters. For reproducible research, we will release the source code, pre-trained FATE model, and CCPD dataset.
